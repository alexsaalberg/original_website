          <p>Image from immediately after I got 'picking' to work. All the cubes are those placed by the mouse. The spikes in the background are the limit of the loaded terrain.</p>

          <p>Very early image from when I was trying to send voxel meshes to the GPU. All the vertices were accidently being rendered in a very small area leading to this spiky-looking object.</p>
